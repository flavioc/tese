I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Ricardo Rocha, for the help and encouragement during
the development of this thesis. He was always there to listen and to give advice. I have
certainly become a better researcher because of him.

To João Santos, João Raimundo, José Vieira and Miguel Areias for the excellent work environment
and companionship.

To all my friends from FEUP, for their friendship and the great moments we have spent together in
the last five years. 

Finally, I would like to thank my parents and sisters, for their unconditional love and support,
and to Joana, for her affection and understanding.
