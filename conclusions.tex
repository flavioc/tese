In this chapter we summarize the work developed in this thesis. First, we list the various contributions
present in the thesis and then we suggest open problems for future research involving the work
developed in this thesis.

\section{Main Contributions}

We can identify two main contributions of this thesis. The first main contribution is the integration of
the TST approach for a call subsumption into YapTab's engine. The second main contribution is the design and implementation
of a new tabling execution mechanism called Retroactive Call Subsumption, that maximizes the sharing of answers
between subsumed/subsuming subgoals. In order to implement the subsumption algorithms and data structures for
these two mechanisms we took advantage of the Time Stamped Tries original proposal from XSB.
This process made us to also understand the differences and similarities between the YapTab and the SLG-WAM tabling engines.

We next detail the most important aspects of the work developed during this thesis:

\begin{description}
   \item[Subsumption-based tabling engine.] Tabled evaluation with subsumptive checks is now supported in Yap Prolog.
   While we integrated the TST algorithms and data structures from SLG-WAM into YapTab, the modifications made to
   YapTab were minimal and thus show that it is possible to add support for subsumption-based tabling to a delaying-based
   tabling engine that already supports variant checks by preserving its own tabling operations and main algorithms.
   In addition, YapTab is now also able to mix variant and subsumption-based tabling in the same program by defining
   the evaluation model for each predicate.
   
   \item[Mechanisms to control retroactive-based execution.] This thesis innovates by presenting a novel execution model
   that is able to prune the execution of specific subgoals when a more general subgoal appears. We developed rules
   for pruning a range of choice points and presented the issues that arise and can lead to completion problems when
   transforming consumer nodes into generators. We also developed an efficient mechanism to detect if a subgoal is
   internal to the execution of another subgoal by building a subgoal dependency tree.
   
   \item[Algorithm to find subsumed subgoals in the table space.] We designed a novel and efficient algorithm that
   can detect the instances of a subgoal that are currently being evaluated. Our design takes advantage of the existing
   WAM machinery and data areas. In order to prune the search space, we extended the subgoal trie data structure with
   information about the status of the subgoals under a subgoal trie node.
   
   \item[Single Time Stamped Trie table space organization.] In the STST table space organization we have a single answer
   trie for each predicate. The answer trie is itself a time stamped trie and permits greater reuse of answers between
   the subgoals of the same predicate, as answers are represented only once. The design facilitates the pruning of
   subsumed subgoals because the subgoals can easily identify which answers have already been consumed or generated.
   We also designed a new optimization, where we throw away the subgoal trie when the most general subgoal completes,
   therefore saving more memory.
   
   \item[Enhanced answer reuse.] The STST table space organization also allows subgoals to immediately reuse answers
   added by other subgoals. This means that when more general subgoal appears, we can first load the answers already
   stored by the subsumed subgoals and only then execute the predicate clauses. This is also a very efficient way of
   handling incomplete tables \cite{Rocha-07a}, because we are not only restricted to an incomplete or complete answer
   set from a single subgoal but we can reuse answers from other subgoals, which can be useful if the subgoal stops
   execution by the cut operator and is called again later.
   
   \item[Support for mixed tabling checks.] Our final system is able to mix variant, subsumption and retroactive-based
   tabling in the same program. This enables the programmer to choose the best evaluation strategy per predicate,
   which arguably can augment the power of tabling for real world programming.
   
   \item[Performance Evaluation.] We evaluated the performance of our subsumption-based tabling engine
   against SLG-WAM with very comparable results, which validates our integration efforts. We also observed
   that by using call subsumption we can potentially cut down on execution time and waste less memory.
   For retroactive-based tabling, we evaluated the overhead of using the new evaluation mechanism with programs that do
   not benefit from retroactive evaluation. For programs were retroactive reuse occurs, we validated our
   approach with good speedups over traditional call subsumption.
   
\end{description}


\section{Further Work}

Despite the contributions enumerated above, still much work is left to be done in the future.
We next summarize further work that can and should be done:

\begin{description}
   
   \item[More efficient algorithms in the table space.] While the algorithms we used for the STST table space
   work pretty well for the majority of applications, there are programs were the overhead of various
   subgoals inserting on the same answer trie can be considerable. Newer algorithms should be developed in order to,
   while preserving the good results for the majority of the cases, solve these deficiencies. Moreover,
   the current implementation cannot benefit from a compiled answer trie until the most general subgoal completes.
   Novel mechanisms must be developed in order to take advantage of the compiled tries optimization while
   allowing answer insertion at the same time.
   
   \item[Experimentation in real world applications.] Our retroactive-based tabling engine still needs more
   experimentation and testing with real world data and applications in order to refine the implementation.
   More intensive experimentation may provide a deep analysis on the algorithms implemented and many opportunities
   to make each algorithm more efficient and/or robust will certainly arise.
   
   \item[Exploration of other execution models.] When using retroactive-based tabling, there are some cases where the
   engine needs to call multiple subgoals of the same predicate in order to calculate the answers for the top subgoal.
   Sometimes, it would be advantageous to \emph{abstract} the running subgoals into a more general subgoal and then
   call it. After that, the top subgoal would use the answers generated by the more general subgoal. This mechanism
   called \emph{call abstraction} was proposed by Johnson et al.~\cite{Johnson-99} and is based on the idea that it
   may be useful for some programs to lose goal directness and generate the full set of answers and then select relevant
   answers from that set. Retroactive-based tabling already includes all the machinery necessary to do that, which makes
   it a good framework to further support call abstraction by devising various analysis techniques of call patterns.
